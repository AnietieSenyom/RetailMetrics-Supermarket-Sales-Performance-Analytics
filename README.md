## Observations & Insights

- Groceries generated the highest revenue among all product categories, contributing the largest share of total sales. This confirms that essential food items drive the core revenue of the supermarket and represent the most consistent source of customer spending.

- Toiletries and snacks showed moderate but steady revenue contributions, while beverages generated the lowest revenue overall. This indicates that non-essential and impulse items play a supporting role rather than acting as primary revenue drivers.

- Lagos emerged as the top-performing store location, accounting for the highest proportion of total revenue, followed by Uyo and Abuja. This reflects stronger customer demand or higher purchasing power in Lagos.

- Cash and POS transactions dominated payment methods, with bank transfers contributing the least revenue. This suggests that customers prefer fast, immediate payment options during in-store purchases.

- Sales trends over time showed fluctuations with noticeable revenue spikes on specific days, indicating that customer purchasing behavior varies daily rather than remaining uniform.

- Product-level analysis revealed that a small group of products contributed disproportionately to total revenue and quantity sold, highlighting the impact of high-performing products on overall sales performance.

## Recommendations

- Since groceries are the primary revenue driver, the supermarket should prioritize inventory availability, supplier reliability, and competitive pricing for essential food items.

- To improve performance in lower-revenue categories such as beverages, targeted promotions, product bundling, and strategic shelf placement can be used to stimulate demand.

- Given Lagos’ strong performance, the business should consider expanding product variety, promotional campaigns, or store capacity in high-performing locations while assessing growth opportunities in underperforming stores.

- The dominance of cash and POS payments suggests maintaining seamless point-of-sale operations, while incentivizing bank transfers through discounts or loyalty rewards could help balance payment channels.

- Daily sales fluctuations present an opportunity to align promotions, staffing levels, and restocking schedules with peak demand periods.

- Top-selling products should be consistently stocked and closely monitored, while slower-moving products can be reviewed for pricing adjustments, promotions, or potential replacement.
